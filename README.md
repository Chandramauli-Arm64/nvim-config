# nvim-config

Neovim for Termux, because apparently I hate myself enough to configure it here.
If you install this, you’re basically agreeing to an extreme sport: configuring text editors on mobile.

This is my personal playground. It works for me because I know where the landmines are.
You? You’re about to find them the hard way.

# Features

- Launches Neovim like a champ (most days).

- Powered by lazy.nvim because I’m lazy and proud of it.

- Pre-configured for Termux weirdness so you don’t have to Google “Why does Neovim hate Termux” at 2 AM.

- Accidentally does useful things sometimes, purely by accident.


# Not Features

- Multi-platform compatibility (I mean, you can try, but don’t).

- Perfect stability — this isn’t a space shuttle, it’s a folding bike held together with duct tape.

- Your dream plugin setup (unless your dream is minimal chaos and occasional rage).

- A warranty of any kind, implied or otherwise.


## Installation

Clone and hope for the best:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chandramauli-Arm64/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

Then cross your fingers and launch nvim.

# Common Symptoms of Using This Config

- Sudden bursts of confidence followed by crushing error messages.

- Knowing you should stop tweaking but not being able to.

- Wondering why the keybind you swear worked yesterday suddenly doesn't.

- Talking to yourself out loud while troubleshooting.

- Questioning your life choices around the 3rd plugin update.

- That one smug “it works on my machine” moment… until it doesn’t.


# Known Bugs That Aren’t Really Bugs but Features I Forgot to Document

- The random keybind that opens a plugin you’ve never seen before — it’s a “surprise mechanic.”

- Occasional color scheme changes mid-session — I call it “dynamic theme rotation,” you call it “WTH just happened.”

- The config sometimes refuses to load on the first try — clearly a feature to make sure you really want to code.

- Plugin updates that remove functionality you were just starting to like — think of it as forced minimalism.

- A startup message that occasionally yells at you — pure motivation.


# The "Maybe" Promise

- If I have time (and motivation, coffee, and no better distractions), I might:

- Fix all the major issues.

- Give you a plug-and-play version that actually works without summoning demons.

- Write a working documentation so you can set this up from scratch or at least understand what’s going on inside my Termux-centric mess.


# How to Complain Effectively

If you insist on filing an issue, follow these steps for maximum results:

1. Read the README (you won’t, but humor me).


2. Triple-check that it’s not listed under “Known Bugs That Aren’t Really Bugs.”


3. Explain exactly what happened without just saying “it’s broken” — I’m not a mind reader.


4. Include logs, screenshots, or an interpretive dance that explains the problem.


5. End with “I know it’s alpha” so I know you’re self-aware.


Failure to follow these steps will result in your issue being marked as “Feature Request” and closed immediately.

# Special Ingredient Warning

- Some parts of this config may contain AI-written code.
- No, I don’t remember where.
- Yes, it’s probably weird.
- Think of it as seasoning — sometimes it’s salt, sometimes it’s cinnamon in your spaghetti.
- If it works, great. If it doesn’t, just assume the AI was “experimenting with new flavors.”

# Disclaimer

- If it breaks, you now own the broken pieces.
- If it works, don’t touch it.
- If you complain, I’ll just say “it’s alpha” and walk away.
